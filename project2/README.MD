# In Class Lab 06 - Luke Oluoch
## Typefaces:
- For the main title, I imported a Pac-Man type of font. Because the article is about videogames, I chose one of the most iconic video game typefaces for the title.
- For the regular headings, I chose a more pixel art, NES type font because it is recognizeable, but more easy to read compared to the Pac-Man font.
- For the regular font, I chose Verdana. It is san-serif, easy to read, and a lot better than the Comic Sans it was before
## Design:
- I fit everything on one page that didn't need scrolling. I put the three games into a card layout using grid.
- I centered the title and put the nav and aside at the top right and left, as the were not related to the content itself
- I colored the individual game cards with a central color from the game's box art. On hover they become a little bit more vibrant and add a shadow.
